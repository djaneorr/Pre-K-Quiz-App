# Overview

This is the beginning of an app that I am developing which acts as a guided quiz. In this app, a parent, guardian, or older sibling will be able to guide a child
(Pre-k or younger) through a series of questions that tests their knowledge on basic shapes. 

This app is a work in progress, as I am mostly done. I manually wrote the questions, and as of now, they will appear in the same order as I programmed them in.

My purpose for creating this software is to help children learn their shapes and (eventually) colors, as a lot of children spend time on a screen. This way, they
can still be on a screen, but they will be learning as well.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio for this app, and even though it took some getting used to, it was easy to learn the layout and to test my code in a simulated phone.

i used three different programming languages throughout this project: HTML, Java, and Kotlin. This project was for me to be more familiar with Kotlin and making apps, so
that was the main programming language that I used for the execution of this project.
